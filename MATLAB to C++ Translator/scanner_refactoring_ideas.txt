We could change the print function accept an argument 
for a file handle and for testing we could change the
file handle from standard out to a file and then create 
another function that compares two files to see if they're 
identical.  We could then use that function inside our 
TS_ASSERT function in the testing suite and compare 
the output to the output in the samples directory.

We could also add tests for each of the functions and 
source files individually.

We could also write a function that replaces readInput
and accepts a string as input and returns a string which
could then be compared without the need for files.
